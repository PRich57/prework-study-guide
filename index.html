          <li>The footer element will be at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

          <li>Semantic HTML Elements: the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          
          <li>Element: Refers to the entirety of the open tag, contents, and closing tag.</li>
          
          <li>Tag: The descriptor between angle brackets that informs the browser and/or programmer of the type of content</li>
          
          <li>&lt;div&gt;: Creates a division in the page - not a semantic element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheet: Programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>

          <li>Inline CSS: Used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML tag using a style attribute. Less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change. <b>EX:</b> &lt;h1 style="color:red;"&gt;</li>

          <li>Internal CSS: Embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; element. The rules only apply to that page but can be used to apply to all elements of the page with corresponding CSS classes and IDs.</li>

          <li>External CSS: Most common method of styling a webpage. This method allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. Used by linking the stylesheet with the &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;</li>

          <li>Separation of Concerns: Term used to describe separating code into different files based on use. Operates on the principle that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>

          <li>Margin: Indicates how much space we want around the <b>outside</b> of an element.</li>

          <li>Padding: adds space around the content <b>inside</b> an element. Increasing padding actually makes the element bigger.</li>

          <li><b>*</b> Selector: A special wild card symbol that declares the following styles will be applied to all elements of the page.</li>

          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together with the use of a comma before adding the CSS rule. This reduces repetition and the use of too many lines of code to achieve the same result. </li>

          <li>DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. Coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
